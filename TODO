TODO 

* actually send SMS
* delete incoming SMS from the device's inbox (pre 4.4?)
* add the stuff for kit-e-kat support
* make sure that incoming messages are not processed twice on kit-e-kat
* support delivery reports
* update proguard config for alarm listener: "For production use, ProGuard may rename your AlarmListener class, which will foul up access to your metadata. To stop this from happening, you will need to add a -keep line to your ProGuard configuration file (e.g., proguard.cfg) to stop ProGuard from renaming it."
* make sure that repeatedly passing the same messages to `medic-gateway` will not result in them being processed multiple times
* don't cancel-and-restart in StartupActivity if not necessary

LATER

* consider if we should be reporting WoMessage.Status.REJECTED, or if this reference should be removed from the API
* include a last-successful-transmission time in case `medic-gateway` has issues reading webapp's response?
* consider authentication - some kind of shared secret?
* get list views working on a reload-on-scroll basis
* tests?
* static analysis?!
* continuous build?!?
* deploy APK to github on build?!?!
* use proper android styles/R-predefs for font size, color etc.
* work out if using a singleton for Db could be problematic
