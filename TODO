* support delivery reports
* wrap system.err calls in if(DEBUG)
* update proguard config for alarm listener: "For production use, ProGuard may rename your AlarmListener class, which will foul up access to your metadata. To stop this from happening, you will need to add a -keep line to your ProGuard configuration file (e.g., proguard.cfg) to stop ProGuard from renaming it."
* make sure that AlarmListener.*Alarms() methods are not called on the main thread
