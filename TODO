IN PROGRESS


TODO

* work out how `medic-gateway` currently handles multipart sms.  and work out how it _should_ handle them.  Reassembly would be very helpful...except in cases where only part of the message is received!  Likely worth looking at IntentProcessor.handleSmsReceived()
* get list views working on a reload-on-scroll basis
* use proper android styles/R-predefs for font size, color etc.
* work out if using a singleton for Db could be problematic
* implement a basic SMS composer that will work when using as default SMS app?
* work out what the HeadlessSmsSendService is and if that needs an implementation too
* add option to switch back to the standard default SMS app
* document kitekat intent requirements in an obscure appendix somewhere
* retry failed WtMessages?
* research BroadcastReceiver.goAsync()
* test SimpleJsonClient2 sets Authorization header when creds are supplied in the URL
* test SMS_RECEIVED_ACTION and SMS_DELIVER_ACTION in IntentProcessor
* test message deletion on kitkat+ and also earlier
* test SmsSender
