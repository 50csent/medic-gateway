# API

All requests are made by `medic-gateway`, to an HTTP(S) endpoint using the `POST` method.

`medic-gateway` will accept and process any relevant data received in a response.  However, it may choose to only send certain types of information in a particular request (e.g. only provide a webapp-terminating SMS), and will also poll the web service periodically for webapp-originating messages, even if it has no new data to pass to the web service.

If there are no entries for a list field (e.g. `deliveries`, `messages`), `medic-gateway` and clients may:

* provide a `null` value; or
* provide an empty array (`[]`); or
* omit the field completely

## Request

### Headers

The following headers will be set by requests:

header           | value
-----------------+-------------------
`Accept`         | `application/json`
`Accept-Charset` | `utf-8`
`Accept-Encoding`| `gzip`
`Cache-Control`  | `no-cache`
`Content-Type`   | `application/json`

Requests and responses may be sent with `Content-Encoding` set to `gzip`.

### Content

	{
		messages: [
			{
				id: <String: uuid, generated by `medic-gateway`>,
				from: <String: international phone number>,
				content: <String: message content>
			},
			...
		],
		deliveries: [
			{
				id: <String: uuid, generated by webapp>,
				status: <String: rejected|failed|delivered>
			},
			...
		],
	}

## Response

### Success

#### Http Status: `2xx`

Clients may respond with any status code in the `200`-`299` range, as they feel is
appropriate.  `medic-gateway` will treat all of these statuses the same.

#### Content

	{
		messages: [
			{
				id: <String: uuid, generated by webapp>,
				to: <String: local or international phone number>,
				content: <String: message content>
			},
			...
		],
	}

### Error

Response codes of `400` and above will be treated as errors.

If the response's `Content-Type` header is set to `application/json`, `medic-gateway` will attempt to parse the body as JSON.  The following structure is expected:

{
	error: true,
	message: <String: error message>
}

The `message` property may be logged and/or displayed to users in the `medic-gateway` UI.


### Other response codes

Treatment of response codes below `200` and between `300` and `399` will _probably_ be handled sensibly by Android.
